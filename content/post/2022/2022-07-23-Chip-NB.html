<p>This is the third entry in the monthly programming and blogging challenge that I have created for myself.
This month I decided that I would create a chip-8 emulator.</p>
<div id="chip-8-and-project-scope" class="section level3">
<h3>Chip-8 and Project Scope</h3>
<p>To quote Cowgod’s technical reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The COSMAC VIP, DREAM 6800, and ETI 660 computers are a few examples. These computers typically were designed to use a television as a display, had between 1 and 4K of RAM, and used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input. The interpreter took up only 512 bytes of memory, and programs, which were entered into the computer in hexadecimal, were even smaller. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I created a chip-8 emulator (not entirely to spec) to play the space invaders rom by David Winter.
Since I was working extra this month at the district office, I wanted to have a more abbreviated project, so I implemented the emulator within a couple of weekends so that I could be free to relax during the week (this did not happen due to work stress unfortunately.)
I did successfully create the chip-8 emulator!
This emulator does play the space invaders rom, but there are several operations that I did not implement.
For example, the random number generator always returns the number four, and the usual audio cues from the game are silent.</p>

<div id="display-implementation" class="section level3">
<h3>Display Implementation</h3>
<p>The chip-8 uses a 64x32 1-bit display, and it is represented in code as an array of bytes.
Originally, I was going to use the different bits of the byte to represent fading of the pixel, but I decided that it looked stupid, so I removed that.
When a pixel is written to the display, it is written into a separate “buffer” array before being copied into the actual display.
This allows the changes to take place on operation boundaries, instead of occurring in the middle of an operation.
The program loop clears the screen when the buffer is “tainted” and then moves the data from the buffer to the display array.
Then the display array is mapped to either a white or black emoji depending on the value.
The mapping is then printed to the screen.
This was the first time that I had implemented my own Display trait for a struct in Rust, and I find it relatively convoluted compared to overriding virtual functions in C#.
Coming from a language that is so much more entwined with OOP might be affected the speed at which I learn Rust.</p>

<div id="operations-instructions-opcodes-and-operationcomponents-oh-my" class="section level3">
<h3>Operations, Instructions, OpCodes, and OperationComponents: Oh my!</h3>
<p>To parse each Instruction from the binary rom file, I keep a Vec of valid operations. These are defined as being comprised of an array of OperationComponents and an OpCode.
OpCode is simply an enum listing the different operations (this gives me a way to reference them at compile time).
OperationComponent is an enum that can have several types representing the bytes in the instruction.
An OperationComponent is either a Literal (meaning that it represents a hexadecimal nibble), or it can be a variable number of nibbles (up to 3).
As chip-8 instructions are all two bytes long, there can be no more than four operation components per each Operation.
An Instruction is the actual instruction that was read from the rom.
The instruction can then be matched with an Operation.
The instruction also provides methods that can be used to read the variable nibbles of the instruction.</p>
<div id="matching-an-instruction-to-an-opcode" class="section level4">
<h4>Matching an Instruction to an OpCode</h4>
<p>To match an instruction to an OpCode, I iterate through the Vec of Operations.
On each of these Operations, I check the definition of OperationComponents.
By iterating through the definition and comparing the equivalent Instruction nibble, I can narrow down the possible instructions.
With a properly implemented list of Operations, there should only be one matching Operation, and therefore only one matching OpCode.
I then return this OpCode, which should match the formatting of the current Instruction.
Next I run different code depending on which OpCode was returned.
Each of the instructions are documented in my below resources.</p>
<pre class="rust"><code>    pub fn get_op_code(instruction: &amp;Instruction) -&gt; Option&lt;OpCode&gt;
    {
        let operations = Operation::get_operations();
        let instruction_bits = instruction.get_bits();
        let matches = operations
            .iter()
            .filter(|cur_op| {
                let mut i = 0usize;
                for comp in &amp;cur_op.definition
                {
                    match comp
                    {
                        OperationComponent::Literal(c) =&gt;
                        {
                            if instruction_bits[i] != *c
                            {
                                return false;
                            }
                            i += 1;
                        }
                        OperationComponent::Nnn =&gt; i += 3,
                        OperationComponent::N =&gt; i += 1,
                        OperationComponent::X =&gt; i += 1,
                        OperationComponent::Y =&gt; i += 1,
                        OperationComponent::Kk =&gt; i += 2,
                    }
                }
                true
            })
            .map(|f| f.op_code)
            .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;OpCode&gt;&gt;();
        matches.first().copied()
    }</code></pre>

<div id="variations-from-the-spec." class="section level3">
<h3>Variations from the Spec.</h3>
<p>As stated earlier, there are a few points where my code differs from the spec for the Chip-8.
This was mostly due to something being either too boring or too time-consuming to implement.
The first thing that I was too lazy to implement was the sound buzzer.
It was unnecessary for the gameplay in the target game.
I suppose it could be added trivially in the countdown thread.
I’ve never really worked on a project with audio in rust before though… perhaps it would be interesting to work on something with an audio aspect in the upcoming months!
Something I was unable to complete due to the time constraints I put on this project is the random number generator.
Now it is set to always return the number four as an homage to the XKCD implementation.
My original intent was to write an implementation of the XORShift pseudo random number generator algorithm.
I have previously implemented it in a project written in assembly, and it is quite trivial in implementation!
I would have implemented this, but I did not have the time or energy to!</p>
